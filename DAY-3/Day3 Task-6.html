      On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to
      coordinate with the overall look of your document. You can use these
      galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and
      other document building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or
      diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look. You can
      easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text by
      choosing a look for the selected text from the Quick Styles gallery on the
      Home tab. You can also format text directly by using the other controls on
      the Home tab. Most controls offer a choice of using the look from the
      current theme or using a format that you specify directly. To change the
      overall look of your document, choose new Theme elements on the Page
      Layout tab. To change the looks available in the Quick Style gallery, use
      the Change Current Quick Style Set command. Both the Themes gallery and
      the Quick Styles gallery provide reset commands so that you can always
      restore the look of your document to the original contained in your
      current template. On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are
      designed to coordinate with the overall look of your document. You can use
      these galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages,
      and other document building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or
      diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look.
